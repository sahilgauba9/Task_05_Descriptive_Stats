# Task_05_Descriptive_Stats & LLMs

This project investigates how large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and the new Google Gemini interpret and respond to natural language queries using structured sports datasets. The dataset focuses on the 2025 season results and team statistics for Syracuse University Women’s Lacrosse.

<h2>Dataset</h2>

 `README.md`         - Provides project overview and instructions      

 <h2>Project Objectives</h2>
 
-Utilize LLMs to answer factual and analytical questions based on sports statistics

-Validate LLM answers against known data through manual fact-checking

-Experiment with different prompts to enhance LLM reasoning and accuracy

<h2>Example Questions Explored</h2>

-How many games did Syracuse play, and how many did they win?

-Did the team perform better in the first half or second half of games?

-Should a coach prioritize offense or defense to increase the number of wins?
