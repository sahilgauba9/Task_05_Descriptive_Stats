<h1>LLM Comparison ChatGPT vs Google Gemini</h1>

This document compares how ChatGPT and Google Gemini responded to the same prompts using the 2025 Syracuse Women’s Lacrosse dataset.

<h1>Q1:How many games did Syracuse play during the 2025 season?</h1>
<h3>Chatgpt</h3>
Syracuse played 19 games during the 2025 season.

<h3>Gemini</h3>
Syracuse played 18 games during the 2025 season, according to the successfully structured game log.

<h3>Evaluation:</h3> Both gave correct answers while ChatGPT giving in a more descriptive way.

<h1>Q2:Was Syracuse stronger in the first or second half of games?</h1>
<h3>Chatgpt</h3>
Chatgpt analyzed Goals by period, Shots by period, and Shots on goal and concluded that Syracuse scored more goals, took more shots, and had more shots on goal in the first half while giving a reasoning on why there was a drop as follows Offensive production drops in the second half, likely due to fatigue, stronger defense from opponents, or game management.

<h3>Gemini</h3>

Syracuse was statistically stronger in the first half of games compared to the second half across all key metrics (Goals, Shots on Goal, and Saves). Also provided takeaways, on the offensive strengths as well as on the defensive performance.

<h3>Evaluation: </h3> Both gave concise answers and I personally felt that ChatGPT gives in a more descriptive way while gemini gives a high level overview.


<h1>Q3:As a coach, should I focus more on offense or defense next season?</h1>
<h3>Chatgpt</h3>
Syracuse’s offense is relatively strong, high shot accuracy and consistent scoring, especially in the first half. Defense is slightly weaker. Opponents have more total shots (552 vs 538) and a high conversion rate once they’re on goal (58%). Several losses were by 1 goal or overtime, indicating close games often came down to defensive stops. Offense is already strong; small improvements there could help, but defense seems the bigger lever to increase wins.

<h3>Gemini</h3>
Coaching Focus: Defense , The data strongly suggests that the defense is the primary limiting factor for the team's success. Weak Link: The 42.3% Save Percentage is the most critical area of concern. A strong Division I team often aims for a save percentage of 45% or higher. 

<h3>Evaluation: </h3> Both had very good reasoning but I personally felt gemini gave more concise as well made very valid assumptions on why we should focus on the other, whereas chatgpt just gave the solutions and very basic recommendations.
